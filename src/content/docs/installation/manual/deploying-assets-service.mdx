title: Deploying the Healthy Assets Service (Recommended Installation)
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

### Cloning the repository

Clone the Healthy Patients API repository from GitHub:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="git">
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SystemJAADE/healthy-assets-service.git
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a folder named 'healthy-assets-service' in your current directory.

### Configuring MinIO

In order to use the Healthy Assets service, we need to have a MinIO server running on our machine.
We must create a bucket called `avatars` in the MinIO administration panel or using the CLI.
In this guide we will use the MinIO CLI to create the bucket.

First we need to add the MinIO server.
Where `SERVER` is the IP or domain of your MinIO server and `PASSWORD` is the password you set when you installed MinIO.
```sh
mc alias set myminio http://SERVER:9000 admin PASSWORD
```

Then we create the `avatars` bucket
```sh
mc mb myminio/avatars
```

And that's it, we have our MinIO server configured.

### Setting up environment variables
Copy the example .env file
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

And modify it according to your needs
<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="nano">
```sh
nano .env
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="vim">
```sh
vim .env
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Orchestrating the containers

If everything went well, you should be able to start healthy-assets-service:
```sh
yarn run-dev
```

And that's it, the Healthy Assets Service will be deployed on your system.
