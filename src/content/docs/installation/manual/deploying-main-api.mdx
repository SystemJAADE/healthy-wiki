title: Deploying the Healthy Patients API (Manual Installation)
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

### Cloning the repository

We clone the Healthy Patients API repository from GitHub:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="git">
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SystemJAADE/healthy-patients-service.git
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a folder called ``healthy-patients-service`` in your current directory.

### Creating a database

We will need to create a database, create a user and give the user all the permissions
to the database. Then we will also need to configure the application to use this database.
```sql
-- You will need to change these values to the ones you want to use
-- DB_NAME
-- DB_USER
-- DB_PASS

-- Creating the database for healthy
CREATE DATABASE DB_NAME;

-- Creating a user to use the database
CREATE USER 'DB_USER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'DB_PASS';

-- Giving the user full access to access all the healthy tables
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DB_NAME.* TO 'DB_USER'@'localhost';

-- Make sure that the privilege changes have been applied immediately
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- Exit the mysql shell
quit
```

Now we will need to create a temporary database (Shadow database) that needs prism as it is used to detect problems in the schema among other things.
detect problems in the schema among other things. The shadow database is only needed in development,
since it is not used in production. For more information go to this link. This database has to be created
from the root user and not from the user we created before.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS shadow_db;
```

### Installing the API dependencies
To install the dependencies we just need to run the following command:
```sh
yarn install
```

### Synchronizing schema changes with the database
Every time the `schema.prisma` file is modified it is necessary to synchronize the changes with the database.
For this we will use the command `npx prisma migrate dev` and then we will name it whatever we want.
These changes will not be committed, since each developer may have different changes in its database.
When the database is finalized and ready to be used in production, the generated file will be commented in order to be able to make use of the system.
generated file will be commented in order to make use of the prism migration system.

:::tip
On MacOS to work correctly it will be necessary to delete the following line from the `schema.prisma` file:

```prisma
binaryTargets = ["windows", "debian-openssl-1.0.x", "debian-openssl-1.1.x", "debian-openssl-3.0.x"]
```

### Configuring Environment Variables
Copy the example `.env` file:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

And modify it according to your needs:
<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="nano">
```sh
nano .env
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="vim">
```sh
vim .env
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Windows">
```sh
notepad .env
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Finalizing Installation

If everything went well, you should be able to start `healthy-patients-service`:
```sh
yarn run-dev
```

And that's it. The Healthy Patients API will be deployed on your system.

You can verify that the application is running correctly by entering the following address in your browser: `http://APP_HOST:APP_PORT`
