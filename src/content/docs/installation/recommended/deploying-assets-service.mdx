title: Deploying the Healthy Assets Service (Recommended Installation)
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

### Cloning the repository

Clone the Healthy Patients API repository from GitHub:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="git">
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SystemJAADE/healthy-assets-service.git
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a folder named 'healthy-assets-service' in your current directory.

### Setting up environment variables
Copy the example .env file
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

And modify it according to your needs
<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="nano">
```sh
nano .env
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="vim">
```sh
vim .env
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Orchestrating the containers

Then, we will use Docker Compose to orchestrate the API containers.
Start the containers in background mode with the following command:
```sh
make docker-dev-run
```

And that's it, the Healthy Assets Service will be deployed on your system.

### Stopping the containers

If you want to stop the containers, you can do so with the following command:
```sh
make docker-dev-stop
```
